${PKGSTEM} is a modified version of Makoto Nukui's portable NEWT/0
NewtonScript implementation. It has been updated by Matthias Melcher
with 64-bit support and additional functionality utilized by the
Einstein Newton OS 2.x emulator.

NewtonScript is an object-oriented programming language developed by
Walter Smith at Apple for the Newton OS running on their MessagePad &
eMate hardware. It borrows concepts from the Smalltalk, LISP, and Self
programming languages with special consideration for a low memory
footprint (esp. differential inheritance).
