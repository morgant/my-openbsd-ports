A portable ProTracker 2 (v2.3D) clone written in C using SDL 2. Aims to
be a highly accurate clone of the classic ProTracker 2.3D software for
Amiga. Has additional audio filters and audio mixer improvements to
make it sound close to a real Amiga computer.

This clone is meant for computers with a modern GPU and CPU (from about
2008 or later recommended). It's also designed for 60Hz monitor refresh
rates, so it can act choppy if you're below/above 60Hz.
