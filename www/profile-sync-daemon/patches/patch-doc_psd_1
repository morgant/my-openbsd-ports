-.SH SUPPORTED DISTROS
-Since psd is just a bash script with a systemd service, it should run on any flavor of Linux running systemd. Several distros provide an official package or user-maintained option to install psd. One can also build psd from source. See the official website for available packages, dependencies, and installation instructions
 .SH FAQ
-Q1: What is overlayfs mode?
-.PP
-A1: Overlayfs is a simple union filesystem mainlined in the Linux kernel version 3.18.0. When used with psd, a reduced memory footprint and faster sync operations can be realized. The magic is in how the overlay mount only writes out data that has changed rather than the entire profile. The same recovery features psd uses in its default mode are also active when running in overlayfs mode.
-.PP
-See the example in the PREVIEW MODE section above which shows a system using overlayfs to illustrate the typical memory savings. Note the "overlayfs size" report compared to the total "profile size" report for each profile. Be aware that these numbers will change depending on just how much new data is written to the profile, but in common use cases, the overlayfs size will always be less than the profile size.
-.PP
-Q2: How do I enable overlayfs mode?
-.PP
-A2: First, be sure psd is not active or else any changes to the config file will be ignored until it is restarted. Overlayfs mode is enabled with the USE_OVERLAYFS= variable which should be set to "yes" in the config file. Psd will automatically detect the overlayfs version available to the kernel if it is configured to use one of them. It is recommended to run psd in preview mode to verify that the system can in fact use overlayfs.
-.PP
-Users wanting to use overlayfs mode MUST have sudo rights without password prompt to /usr/bin/psd-overlay-helper or global sudo rights without password prompt. If the user does not have global rights, add the following line to /etc/sudoers after any other lines defining sudo access. It is recommended to use /usr/bin/visudo as root to set this up:

-.fam T
-.fi
-Q3: Why do I have another browser profile directory "foo-back-ovfs" when I enable overlayfs?
-.PP
-A3: The way overlayfs works is to mount a read-only base copy (so-called lower dir) of the profile, and manage the new data on top of that. In order to avoid resyncing to the read-only filesystem, a copy is used instead. So using overlayfs is a trade-off: faster initial sync times and less memory usage vs. disk space in the home dir.
-.PP
-Q4: I need more memory to accommodate my profile/profiles in /run/user/xxxx. How can I allocate more?
-.PP
-A4: The standard way of controlling the size of /run/user/ is the RuntimeDirectorySize directive in logind.conf (see the man page for logind.conf for more). By default, 10% of physical memory is used but one can increase it safely. Remember that tmpfs only consumes what is actually used; the number specified here is just a maximum allowed.
-.PP
 Q5: My system crashed for some reason and psd didn't sync back. What do I do?
 .PP
 A5: The "last good" backup of the browser profile/profiles should be the filesystem. Upon restarting psd (on a reboot for example), a check is performed to see if the symlink to the tmpfs copy of the profile is invalid. If it is invalid, psd will snapshot the "last good" backup before it rotates it back into place. This is more for a sanity check that psd did no harm and that any data loss was a function of something else.
