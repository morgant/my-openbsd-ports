Profile-sync-daemon (psd) is a tiny pseudo-daemon designed to manage
browser profile/profiles in tmpfs and to periodically sync back to the
physical disc (HDD/SSD). This is accomplished by an innovative use of
rsync to maintain synchronization between a tmpfs copy and media-bound
backup of the browser profile/profiles. Additionally, psd features
several crash-recovery features.
